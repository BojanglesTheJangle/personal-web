            <p>I have been coding for quite some time! I started around 2022 or 2023; I'm not sure which year. But I have expanded a LOT. First, I learned how to program in Roblox using Lua. It was quite simple, an hour tutorial and some notes helped me keep track and remember,
                And I was pretty decent, not making any popular games but having lots of fun making them. I learned a bit of Python, experimented with CSS a lot with some websites, learned a bit of HTML, JavaScript, GDScript, and probably a bit more than I can remember. I've made a lot of
                programs in the past that might be lost in time, somewhere in my hard drives, or other things. More recently, I've been really liking the Godot game engine and messing around and making games in my spare time. There is one game I really like the idea of, and I might make a full version of it.
                But more importantly, I am learning C++ to make a game engine/game with OpenGL to understand how the rendering happens and how we can all learn some optimization methods. Outside of programming, I have some music skills, and I am writing some small songs for projects or other people!
                I am also into hardware, as I have fixed multiple things, jailbroken consoles, and developed some useful hardware for myself. I even built my own computer! The journey is far but fun.
